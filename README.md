## What is Torch?

Torch is a 2D survival game akin to Terraria. However, your goal is not to explore, cultivate, and conquer the game world; rather you are the game itself, fighting the player back from progressing. 10+ endings!

The game consists of utilizing three different cards (Fall, Drench, and Combust) in order to manipulate the game world in a variety of ways.  By doing so, you sabotage the player in their pursuit of the ultimate  goal of the game: creating and lighting torch. Gripping, I know, but there are a number of ways to prevent the player from achieving this monumental task; each awarding a different ending. Have fun discovering each one!

## How to Play

Right-click and drag cards over game objects to act upon them with the power of the selected card. R to reset.
